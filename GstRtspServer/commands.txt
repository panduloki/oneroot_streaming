	1. Correct RTP Stream Format
	The incoming stream matched the expected format:
	RTP payload type 96 was correctly mapped to H.264 video.
	The encoding (high-4:4:4 profile) was compatible with avdec_h264.
	2. Capabilities (Caps) Matching
	The elements successfully negotiated their capabilities (caps) at each stage:
	rtph264depay produced raw H.264 frames with properties 
	(video/x-h264) that avdec_h264 could handle.
	avdec_h264 decoded the frames to raw video in Y444, and videoconvert
	ensured compatibility with the display sink (autovideosink).
	3. Dynamic Latency Adjustment
	The "Redistribute latency..." message indicates that GStreamer adjusted
	latencies in the pipeline to synchronize live video playback. 
	This mechanism is essential for real-time streams over networks where delays can vary.
	4. No Missing Plugins
	All necessary GStreamer plugins were available and loaded:
	rtph264depay: For depayloading RTP packets.
	avdec_h264: For decoding H.264 video.
	videoconvert and autovideosink: For rendering the video.
	5. System Resources Were Adequate
	If there was high CPU or memory usage earlier,
	the pipeline may have struggled to run. The current success could 
	indicate that system resources are now sufficient.
