Here are the common Tailscale commands you can use on your Raspberry Pi (or any system with Tailscale installed):

Basic Tailscale Commands
Start the Tailscale service
To start Tailscale, run:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start tailscaled
Stop the Tailscale service
To stop Tailscale, run:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl stop tailscaled
Enable Tailscale to start on boot
To make sure Tailscale starts automatically on boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable tailscaled
Check the status of Tailscale
To check if Tailscale is running:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status tailscaled
Authentication and Connection
Authenticate and connect to Tailscale
When setting up, you can use the tailscale up command to authenticate and connect your device to your Tailscale network:

bash
Copy code
sudo tailscale up
This will provide a URL for you to open in your browser and authenticate with your Tailscale account (Google, Microsoft, or other login options).

Log out of Tailscale
To disconnect from your Tailscale network:

bash
Copy code
sudo tailscale down
View the current Tailscale status
This shows the status of your Tailscale connection (e.g., the device's Tailscale IP address):

bash
Copy code
tailscale status
This will show information like:

The Tailscale IP address of your device.
Other devices connected to your Tailscale network.
Show your Tailscale IP
If you want just the Tailscale IP address:

bash
Copy code
tailscale ip
Network and Device Management
List devices on your Tailscale network
The tailscale status command will also list other devices connected to your network.

Send a message to another device
You can send a message to a specific device on your network (works with supported systems):

bash
Copy code
tailscale send <device-name> <message>
Route traffic through Tailscale (subnet routing)
If you want to allow your Raspberry Pi to route traffic to another network, you can set up subnet routing. For example:

bash
Copy code
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=<subnet>
Replace <subnet> with the subnet you want to advertise (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Enable DNS resolution via Tailscale
If you want Tailscale to handle DNS for your network, you can set it up like this:

bash
Copy code
sudo tailscale up --accept-dns=false --advertise-dns
Advanced Configuration
Check network routes advertised via Tailscale
You can see the routes being advertised through your Tailscale network:

bash
Copy code
tailscale netstat
Set a persistent hostname
You can set a custom hostname for your device in Tailscale:

bash
Copy code
sudo tailscale up --hostname <your-custom-hostname>
Change your Tailscale key or reauthenticate
If needed, you can trigger a new authentication:

bash
Copy code
sudo tailscale up --reset
Troubleshooting
Check Tailscale logs
For troubleshooting, check the logs for any issues:

bash
Copy code
sudo journalctl -u tailscaled
Display more detailed status information
For more detailed information on the Tailscale status and connection:

bash
Copy code
tailscale status --verbose
