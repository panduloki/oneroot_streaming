1)first update the system

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade

sudo reboot

2)check chrome was installed and update it
sudo apt install chromium-browser -y
sudo apt upgrade chromium-browser


3)install build essential
sudo apt install build-essential -y


4)check python installed and version
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip -y

5) install git
sudo apt install git -y

Basic Git Setup:
After installing Git, configure your username and email (important for committing code):

git config --global user.name "rasberrypi"
git config --global user.email "onerootrasberrypi@gmail.com"

1. Check if SSH is Installed and Enabled
SSH is usually pre-installed on Raspberry Pi. To ensure the SSH service is running:

Enable SSH:
sudo raspi-config

Go to Interface Options > SSH > Select Yes.
Alternatively, start the SSH service manually:
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh

2. Generate an SSH Key
Open a terminal and run:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "onerootrasberrypi@gmail.com"

Use the -t ed25519 algorithm for better security (or use rsa if necessary with -t rsa -b 4096).

When prompted, press Enter to save the key to the default location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519).

Optionally, enter a passphrase for added security.
After the key is generated, you'll see output like this:
Your identification has been saved in /home/pi/.ssh/id_ed25519.

3. Copy Your Public Key
Display your public key to copy it:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Copy the output (it begins with ssh-ed25519 or ssh-rsa).

4. Add SSH Key to Your Git Platform
GitHub:

Go to GitHub SSH settings.
Click New SSH Key.
Paste your public key and give it a name.

5. Test Your Connection
Test the SSH connection to your platform:
For GitHub:
ssh -T git@github.com

You should see a success message if the setup is correct.

6. Clone Repositories Using SSH
Now, you can clone repositories using SSH instead of HTTPS. Example:
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
